# React Components as Routes Lab

## Overview

In this lab, you will create a simple Client-Side routing application with
__React Router__.

## Objectives

* Practice building an application with __React Router__
* Access routes using a Navbar with matched routes
* Visit different "views" in the application by accessing different routes

## React Router App

In this lab we are going to build out an application that has routes for a Home
Page, Actors Page, Movies Page and Directors Page. Our goal is to provide routes
and links for these 4 pages.

This is what our app should look like when we are done with this lab:

* [Home Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/react-router-lab-home-page.png)
* [Movies Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/react-router-lab-movies-page.png)
* [Directors Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/react-router-lab-directors-page.png)
* [Actors Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/react-router-lab-actors-page.png)

Let's work through this one component at a time

### Components

Our `src` folder contains the following:

```text
src/
├── data.js
├── index.js
|-- containers/
|   |-- App.js
└── components/
    ├── Actors.js
    ├── Directors.js
    ├── Home.js
    ├── Movies.js
    └── NavBar.js
```

All of the file and module imports are done for you, so you just need to focus
on the JSX for these components.

#### `Index.js`

Our `index.js` file is completed for us. It loads App as the top level component.

#### `data.js`

This file contains seed data for __Actors, Movies & Directors__

## Component Info

#### `App`

This component already contains a `Router` wrapper where we'll include our
particular routes. Inside this element, we'll need to render our `Navbar` and 4
__React Router__ `Route` components with paths to __/, /movies, /directors &
/actors__ and rendering the respective components. When a user visits the root
URL, they should see the `Home` component.

**Note**: Since a `Router` wrapper can only wrap one child element, use a `div` to
wrap the `Navbar` and `Route`s. This allows us to apply a CSS class at the App
component level.

#### `Navbar`

This component needs to render 4 `<NavLink>` components. They will be for __/,
/movies, /directors, /actors__ <-- in this order(test checks for this).

#### `Home`

This component should render the text `Home Page` in an `<h1>`.

#### `Movies`

This component should render the text `Movies Page` in an `<h1>`, and make a new `<div>` for
each movie. The `<div>` should contain the movie's title, time and a `<ul>` with a list of its
genres.

#### `Directors`

This component should render the text `Directors Page` in an `<h1>`, and make a new `<div>`
for each director. The `<div>` should contain the director's name and a `<ul>` with a list
of their movies.

#### `Actors`

This component should render the text `Actors Page` in an `<h1>`, and make a new `<div>` for
each actor. The `<div>` should contain the actor's name and a `<ul>` with a list of their
movies. 

> Note: The tests will count how many `<div>`s are nested inside your `Movies`, `Directors`, and `Actors` components. So to get tests to pass, you must create _exactly one_ `<div>` for each movie, director, or actor, and no additional nested `<div>`s in those components.
